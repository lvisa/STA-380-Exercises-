This repository contains exercises for the STA 380 course. The main exercises are structured within the Jupyter Notebook named "STA 380 Part 2 Exercises". The detailed breakdown of these exercises, along with other supplementary exercises contained in separate folders, is given below.

Table of Contents:
1.	Main Jupyter Notebook Exercises
2.	Association Rule Mining Exercise Folder
3.	Image Classification with Neural Networks Folder

Main Jupyter Notebook Exercises

The "STA 380 Part 2 Exercises" Jupyter notebook encompasses the following exercises:

•	Probability Practice
•	Wrangling the Billboard Top 100
•	Visual Story Telling Part 1
•	Visual Story Telling Part 2
•	Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
•	Market Segmentation
•	Reuters C50

Association Rule Mining Exercise Folder

Contained within the "Association Rule Mining exercise" folder, this includes:

•	groceries.csv: The dataset used for this exercise.
•	grocery_association_rule_mining.Rmd: R script detailing the process and analysis of the exercise.
•	grocery_association_rule_mining.pdf: A report documenting the results and findings.

Image Classification with Neural Networks Folder

Due to the lengthy processing time required for this exercise, it's separated from the main notebook. The folder consists of:

•	CNN - Jupyter Notebook: The Python code written in a Jupyter Notebook format.
•	CNN - Jupyter Notebook.pdf: A comprehensive report that presents the results and analysis.

Note: The separation of this exercise is intentional, as the computational time to run and process the data is quite extensive.
